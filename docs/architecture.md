# PulseStack Architecture

PulseStack is organized as a TypeScript monorepo with shared contracts, a shared infra layer, independently deployable service entrypoints, and a React operations console.

## Services

- `pulse-runtime`: workflow execution, state snapshots, event emission, span creation.
- `pulse-events`: event ingress, NATS fanout, Redis Streams buffering, websocket stream delivery.
- `pulse-trace`: execution trace retrieval over ClickHouse.
- `pulse-replay`: deterministic replay from persisted snapshots and side-effect recordings.
- `pulse-metrics`: event volume and latency aggregations from ClickHouse.
- `pulse-graph`: DAG reconstruction from stored workflow definitions.
- `pulse-gateway`: API gateway and websocket bridge for the UI and SDKs.
- `pulse-web`: real-time operations console.

## Data Plane

1. `pulse-runtime` stores workflow definitions in PostgreSQL.
2. Executions are inserted into PostgreSQL and step snapshots are written after each step.
3. Events are published to NATS, appended to Redis Streams, and inserted into ClickHouse.
4. Trace spans are stored in ClickHouse for timeline analysis and latency aggregation.
5. `pulse-replay` reads stored snapshots and reconstructs a deterministic replay state with a diff against the original output.

## Plugin Event Flow

PulseStack loads local plugins from `PLUGIN_DIR` during `pulse-events` and `pulse-runtime` startup. Each plugin directory must include a `plugin.json` manifest and an entrypoint module that may export `onEvent(event, context)`.

When a service calls `publishEvent()`, the event is still persisted to NATS, Redis Streams, and ClickHouse first. After persistence succeeds, PulseStack dispatches the same event to loaded plugins that implement `onEvent`. Plugin failures are isolated with `Promise.allSettled()` and logged with the plugin name, event type, and error message so one extension cannot crash the runtime request path.

Local development flow:

1. Create a directory under `plugins/`.
2. Add `plugin.json` with `name`, `version`, `entrypoint`, and `capabilities`.
3. Export `onEvent` from the entrypoint.
4. Start services with `PLUGIN_DIR=./plugins`.

The bundled `plugins/audit-log` plugin logs every dispatched event and can be used as a minimal event-handler template.

## Storage

- PostgreSQL: workflow metadata, executions, replay snapshots.
- Redis: event stream fanout and ephemeral queue state.
- ClickHouse: high-volume event and trace analytics.
- NATS: low-latency event bus.
